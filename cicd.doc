1. Create 3 directories frontend, backend, nginx
 Frontend
  - This contains code for react.js from assignment
  - Created a docker image using docker file  with base image node:16-alpine3.11 and copied app directory and exposed 3000
  - Pushed the docker image to docker hub 
  
 Backend
  - This contains code for node.js from assignment
  - Created a docker image using docker file  with base image node:16-alpine3.11 and copied server directory exposed 5151
  - Pushed the docker image to docker hub
  
  NGINX
  - Created a docker image using docker file  with base image nginx:1.19.10 and created njinx.conf with custom reverse proxy and replaced /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf and exposed 8080
  
  2. Create a docker-compose.yml
    - create 3 services frontend, backend, nginx. 
    - proxy: downloaded created image from docker hub repo and mapped ports 8080:80
    - frontend: downloaded created image from docker hub repo and mapped volumes app on local and passed on environmental variables for ip and port and mapped port 3000:3000
    - backend: downloaded created image from docker hub repo and mapped volumes server on local and passed on environmental variables for ip and port 5151:5151
